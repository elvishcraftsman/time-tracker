# About Time Tracker
A simple time-tracker program for GNOME. Instead of using online-first options like Toggl and Clockify, use a lightning-fast local-first option that is still able to sync with multiple computers via cloud or network storage.
Time Tracker allows you to track different projects, see how much time you've spent on each project, and sync with a local file or a file in your own cloud storage. You can also open your sync file in spreadsheet software (since it's a CSV file).
## Tracking
- Track the amount of time spent on different projects.
- Save the timer so that when Time Tracker is closed and reopened, it will continue tracking the same project, including the time while Time Tracker was closed.
## Syncing
- Sync with a local file somewhere in your home directory or just in the app's own system directory.
- Or sync with a file in your cloud storage (if mounted in home directory).
## Reporting
- See how much time you've spent on each project today, this week, and last week.
## Backups
- Automatically save daily backups and keep a user-specified number of past backups.
## Preferences
- Set preferred first day of week for reporting purposes.
- Set how frequently Time Tracker autosaves.
- Set how many daily backups you want Time Tracker to keep.
- Set whether to use 24-hour format or 12-hour (AM/PM) format.
